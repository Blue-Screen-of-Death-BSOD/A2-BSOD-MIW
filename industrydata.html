              <p>Although my ideal job hasn't changed, I found the burning glass data exciting and evident of the style of work required in the IT industry. I wasn't surprised to see communication, problem-solving, and team collaboration made the top 5 for general skills. However, I found the IT skills less relevant because there are many different opportunities and specializations in IT and software. Even though the data suggests the most in-demand IT skill is writing SQL, I believe that most people in the industry will have foundational knowledge in languages like Java or C++ because these are skills in far greater demand with companies like Atlassian continuing to hire people with these skills. Moreover, reading and writing code in languages older than something like Wifi (1997) is an invaluable skill in software maintenance and redesigning IT systems.</p>

              <p>After reading and analyzing the statistics on burning glass, my ideal job has shifted. There are many skills needed to be successful in this job, with little demand and growth. A career focusing on SQL and javascript would be better as these skills are more in order. On top of that, a job that requires more general skills such as; communication, problem-solving, and team collaboration would allow me to work in a more high-demand job.</p>

              <p>Burning Glass states that Financial Accountants are the top 5 in-demand permanent roles in the financial department. Knowing this, my opinion of my ideal job has not changed, and the Burning Glass data has reassured me that finding a job in such a large industry while having an enormous demand will not make it too challenging to find a suitable position at a company. In addition, this data tells me that I would have the ability to gain experience in this role at multiple companies and work in a range of different types of businesses and business sizes without worrying about job security in terms of work demand.

              <p>After reviewing the Burning Glass statistics, my ideal job has shifted. This is due to the skill set required as well as its lo w-end/decent demand from employers. The skill set required to work as an IT Technical Support Analyst is simple and straightforward. This also tells me that the job can be done by someone who hasn't obtained any higher education, such as a bachelor's degree. Furthermore, this job's ranking confirms my decision to shift dream occupations. The score indicates that there is a low demand for IT technical Support Analysts, implying that there are few openings.</p>

              <p>According to Burning Glass, I should change my ideal job to web developers. The growth of 13% proved more people would apply for the job as a web developer. If I continue staying with WordPress Developer, I might face limited experience with various web design platforms. With web developers, I can work with a range of web designs with various scales, from small to large; by that, the changes aim to adapt to more project offers in the market.</p>

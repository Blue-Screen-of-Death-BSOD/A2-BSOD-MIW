                <h2>Clapp questions</h2>
                <h3>1.	What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>
                <p>The IT professional works around communication and business systems to help bring corporate strategies to fruition. The value of this is that the professional can convert the corporate strategy to natural management of employees in the IT department of the organization. Bridging these two groups creates efficiency on a human level reflected on an IT system level through execution.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>2.	What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? </h3>
                <p>The professional interacts with other stakeholders in the business, such as employees and corporate management, but does not necessarily interact with customers or clients. The professional does interact with software providers for licensing purposes and to negotiate terms. However, the general public is usually not included in any of these groups directly. Indirectly, the professional’s management of the company’s services helps the available public customers.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>3.	Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? </h3>
                <p>The IT professional spends most of their time in online meetings (due to covid procedures) managing staff and discussing essential decisions such as staff allocation and business strategies.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>4.	What aspect of their position is most challenging? </h3>
                <p>The IT professional needs to balance multiple stakeholders' priorities without compromising on one. One example is thats: customer service needs to have an efficient system that meets the same supply of staff consumers demands. If demand is too high, the system could break down or require more staffing to meet the consumer stakeholder priorities. However, this doesn't help the business' efficiency of minimizing costs. One solution to meet surges in service demand and prices is implementing an automated IVR system that handles basic inquiries without human operators.</p>

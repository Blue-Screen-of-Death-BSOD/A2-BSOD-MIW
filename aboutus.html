                    <p>Throughout assignment 2, our group (Blue screen of death) exceeded delegating tasks between the group members, so every person had their role. On top of that, each group member was good at completing their task to the group's timelines for each other. For the meetings that were conducted, members of the group were good at being punctual and showing up on time, and during meetings, communication flowed easily, and we were all able to collaborate productively and effectively on ideas quickly, and there was no awkward silence. There was a large amount of respect between group members when collaborating on ideas which created a positive environment that helped encourage further collaboration. The group was well organized when it came to google docs and team for collaboration. The group was good at creating and organizing google docs for the report and each meeting, so each member had a good point of reference for what they needed to have completed for that week. We were also scheduling meetings on Microsoft teams, so it was easy to see when the next meeting was taking place.
                        <br><br>Although our communication in meetings and calls went well, our communication outside calls via messenger/Microsoft teams was not so well with responses taking a while to be read and replied to. There was also a substantial lack of communication at the beginning of assignment 2 (however, it steadily improved throughout the weeks of completing assignment 2). With this being said, there could have been much improvement in these areas in the form of perhaps more meetings to be done earlier in the assignment and maybe a fixed time where everyone can see/read/reply to messages during the day. Another area which could have seen some improvements is working more together on certain parts, this way the work would be proofread by one or more members of the group and the quality of the work would be increased. An improvement of communication outside of calls could have improved our teamwork on specific tasks. Another way this could be improved could have been by doing proportions of work together rather than a whole part individually (this is harder to implement, though, and it is much easier to delegate work evenly if it is done individually).

                        <p>The group didn't start on the best of notes as some members did not turn up to the tutorials, so we could not make contact with group members. As we were unable to contact group members, it wasn't easy to delegate tasks. While not every group member attended every group meeting, every member completed the job they were given by the date the group set for completion. The only issue with this is that it is challenging to convey if you think what they wrote should be changed. After we established who the group members were, the group excelled at delegating tasks between each other. The group is also very good at communicating during group meetings. One surprising thing was how difficult it is to complete group work during covid. I learned about groups that it is essential to organize the job and the tasks that need to be completed, so it is easy for members of the group to see what needs to be completed. Dang organizing and formatting all the group's documents was very helpful for the group.</p>

                        <p>There were mishaps at the beginning of the assignment, as there might have been some miscommunication.m However, after establishing roles for each person, the group had little to no problem completing their delegated tasks. The meeting at the beginning did not have a great structure, but they became more productive toward the end, with each member contributing and doing their work on time. There was clear individual leadership, and everyone was open to criticism. I have learned that in the future of group assignments, I need to speak up more and get more involved in the organization, so I dont have issues with miscommunication. Considering this assignment was done during the lockdown, I believe this group did very well. Dang did an excellent job of taking leadership by initiating contact with all members; Claira also did an excellent job of beginning communication and delegating tasks for everyone. There were ways that I could have improved. Thankfully this group did well by keeping me on track and helping me where I needed it.</p>

                        <p>There was a slow start to the group assignment, with minimal communication/communication issues with some original group members not ever communicating and then being kicked. After our first meeting, the group started to work well together (however, some members couldn't attend the panels). We delegated tasks very well, even improved communication (inside and outside of meetings) and feedback on each other's work. Once we reached the middle of the group assignment time, we realized that we all were working well on our delegated tasks and roles, and we saw that everyone completed/was on track to achieving their parts, so there were no issues with last minute work and stress. I have learned that I need to improve on in-group assignments is that I should ask for feedback more from other group members to ensure the work is done with good quality and to ensure everyone knows what is happening in terms of the work.</p>

                        <p>With only a few exceptions, members of the group routinely attended meetings. Team members were respectful of each other's views and, at the very least respectful of each other when they attended team meetings. This can be shown in team members' ability to let one person talk at a time without being interrupted. In addition, the level of collaboration was outstanding. Every team member was able to execute their assigned tasks to a high standard and on schedule and contribute to ideas swiftly and effectively. Furthermore, hats off to Dang for his tireless efforts in bringing all of the team's ideas together to create a high-quality website using GitHub. The team deserves kudos for their outstanding contributions to complete this assignment.</p>

                        <p>It was evident that each member of the group could perform his or her work within the set timescales. We were all able to contribute quickly and efficiently to ideas. More than all, members in a group are listen and respect each other's ideas; we all come up with ideas together, ready to help other members who need support on their part. At the team, we need more communication; more communication between teams members will help each other understand the ideas in more detail. Claira Burn has done an excellent job connecting team members and preventing the "quiet place" during a group meeting. As a member of BSOD, I have learned many new things; our members have come up with many creative ideas that I never thought it before. Our processes to select are collecting, brainstorming, and generating feasibility ideas. I use the Github repository to communicate with the team in coding websites; members could keep track and give feedback on what I code.</p>
